For version compatibility reasons, some MC classes need to be renamed in the development environment.  These are classes that were renamed between MCP builds, but otherwise are the same; renaming them to a standard name simplifies abstractions against them.

NOTE: The standard `genSrgs` task is broken in terms of custom SRGs, or at least seems to be.
